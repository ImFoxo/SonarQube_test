You are an expert Senior Frontend Developer. Your task is to build a Habit Tracker application called "HabitTrac" based on the attached UI images and the specific technical architecture described below.

### TECH STACK:
- **Framework:** React + TypeScript (Vite)
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS (Crucial for replicating the clean, modern gray/blue aesthetic in the images)
- **Charts:** Recharts (For statistics)
- **Icons:** Lucide-React
- **Routing:** React-Router-Dom
- **State Management:** React Context API (via Providers)

### UI VISUAL REFERENCE (See attached images):
Please replicate the following views with high visual fidelity:
1.  **Landing Page (Image 1):** Minimalist entry with "Habit Tracker" heading and "Start Now" button.
2.  **Main Dashboard (Image 2):** Sidebar navigation, Calendar view (month), "My Habits" checklist, and "My Dashboard" summary widgets.
3.  **User Profile (Image 3):** User stats header, "Statistics" cards (Streak, Total habits), "Achievements" badges, and "Friend updates".
4.  **Habit Creation Modal (Image 4):** A "Habit Tracking Overview" modal with a description, group selection, and a slider input (1-10).
5.  **Statistics Page (Image 5):** Detailed data table (Daily Steps, Sleep) and bar charts for progress.

### MANDATORY PROJECT STRUCTURE (Feature-Sliced Design):
You must strictly adhere to this folder structure. Do not group files by type (e.g., do not put all components in one folder). Group them by **Feature**.
